She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out.

    "We can make a visual argument as to whether we believe the observed statistic is consistent with Emily’s model. Here, since larger values of the test statistic suggest the alternative model (where the chance of guessing the correct hand is something other than 50%), we can formalize our analysis by finding what proportion of simulated statistics were as large or larger than our observed test statistic (the area at or to the right of the observed test statistic). If this area is small enough, we’ll declare that the observed data are inconsistent with our simulated model.

    "By convention, we often compare the proportion we just calculated to 0.05. If the proportion of simulated statistics greater than or equal to the observed statistic is sufficiently small (less than or equal to 0.05), then this is evidence against Emily's model. Conceptually, you may think of this as the case where less than 5% of simulated values are as far or farther away from what we had expected. If this is not the case, we don’t have any reason to doubt Emily’s model. \n",

TT practitioners hit back and accused Emily and her family of tampering with the results, while some claimed that Emily's bad spiritual mood towards therapeutic touch made it difficult to read her HEF. Whatever it may be, Emily's experiment is a classic example about how anyone, with the right resources, can test anything they want!"
